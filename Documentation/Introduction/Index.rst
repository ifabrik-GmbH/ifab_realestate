This extension implements a simple real estate structure (based on OpenImmo) and properties can be created with ease and displayed on the FrontEnd. We offer an automatic OpenImmo importer which gets the exported properties and imports them into the TYPO3 CMS. For more information regarding the OpenImmo importer, contact us via mail on info@ifabrik.de.
