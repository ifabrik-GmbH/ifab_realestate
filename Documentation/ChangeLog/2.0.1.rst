===========
TCA Changes
===========

Some TCA changes have been made in order to make the editor's life easier.

The **Attachment group value** has now it is own table in order for the editor to only write the value once and be able to select it via a select dropdown.

.. figure:: ../Images/attachmentValue.png
    :class: with-shadow
    :width: 80%
    :alt: Attachment Value

The very same thing happens on the **Property type value**

    :class: with-shadow
    :width: 80%
    :alt: Property type
